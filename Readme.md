New method:
Certainly. The vSphere Automation SDK for Python is indeed a more modern and feature-rich option for interacting with VMware vSphere environments. Let's create an example that demonstrates how to use this SDK to connect to a vSphere environment, list VMs, and perform some basic operations that could be useful for VM placement algorithms.
vSphere Automation SDK Example: VM and Host OperationsClick to open code:

```bash
from vmware.vapi.vsphere.client import create_vsphere_client
from com.vmware.vcenter_client import VM, Host
from com.vmware.vapi.std_client import DynamicID
import urllib.parse
import requests
import ssl

def connect_to_vsphere(server, username, password):
    session = requests.Session()
    session.verify = False
    requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

    client = create_vsphere_client(server=server, username=username, password=password, session=session)
    return client

def list_vms(client):
    vm_list = client.vcenter.VM.list()
    print("Virtual Machines:")
    for vm in vm_list:
        vm_info = client.vcenter.VM.get(vm.vm)
        print(f"  Name: {vm.name}")
        print(f"    Power State: {vm_info.power_state}")
        print(f"    CPU Count: {vm_info.cpu.count}")
        print(f"    Memory Size MB: {vm_info.memory.size_mib}")
        print("---")

def list_hosts(client):
    host_list = client.vcenter.Host.list()
    print("Hosts:")
    for host in host_list:
        host_info = client.vcenter.Host.get(host.host)
        print(f"  Name: {host.name}")
        print(f"    Connection State: {host_info.connection_state}")
        print(f"    Power State: {host_info.power_state}")
        print("---")

def get_vm_host(client, vm_name):
    vm_list = client.vcenter.VM.list(VM.FilterSpec(names=set([vm_name])))
    if not vm_list:
        print(f"VM '{vm_name}' not found")
        return None
    
    vm = vm_list[0].vm
    vm_info = client.vcenter.VM.get(vm)
    host = vm_info.host
    host_info = client.vcenter.Host.get(host)
    return host_info

def relocate_vm(client, vm_name, target_host_name):
    # Find the VM
    vm_list = client.vcenter.VM.list(VM.FilterSpec(names=set([vm_name])))
    if not vm_list:
        print(f"VM '{vm_name}' not found")
        return

    vm = vm_list[0].vm

    # Find the target host
    host_list = client.vcenter.Host.list(Host.FilterSpec(names=set([target_host_name])))
    if not host_list:
        print(f"Host '{target_host_name}' not found")
        return

    target_host = host_list[0].host

    # Relocate the VM
    relocate_spec = VM.RelocateSpec(host=target_host)
    client.vcenter.VM.relocate(vm, relocate_spec)
    print(f"VM '{vm_name}' has been relocated to host '{target_host_name}'")

def main():
    server = "vcenter.example.com"
    username = "your_username"
    password = "your_password"

    client = connect_to_vsphere(server, username, password)

    list_vms(client)
    list_hosts(client)

    # Example: Get the host of a specific VM
    vm_name = "example_vm"
    host_info = get_vm_host(client, vm_name)
    if host_info:
        print(f"VM '{vm_name}' is on host: {host_info.name}")

    # Example: Relocate a VM
    target_host = "target_host_name"
    relocate_vm(client, vm_name, target_host)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```




This example demonstrates several key operations using the vSphere Automation SDK for Python:

Connecting to a vSphere environment
Listing VMs and their properties
Listing hosts and their properties
Finding which host a specific VM is running on
Relocating a VM to a different host

To use this code:

First, you need to install the vSphere Automation SDK. You can do this using pip:
Copypip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-automation-sdk-python.git

Replace the server, username, and password variables in the main() function with your vCenter Server details.
Modify the vm_name and target_host variables to match VMs and hosts in your environment.
Run the script.

This code provides a foundation for implementing VM placement algorithms. You could extend it to:

Gather detailed resource information about hosts and VMs.
Implement your placement algorithms (BFD, FFD, ACO) using this real-world data.
Perform actual VM relocations based on the results of your algorithms.

For example, to implement the Best Fit Decreasing algorithm:

Use list_vms() and list_hosts() to gather information about all VMs and hosts.
Sort the VMs by resource requirements (CPU, memory) in descending order.
For each VM, use the host information to determine the best fit.
Use relocate_vm() to move the VM to the chosen host.


# Cloud Computing Project

This project aims to implement six algorithms for the virtual machine placement problem in cloud computing. The algorithms are as follows:
- First Fit Decreasing Memory (FFDM)
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Python 3.7 or later
* pip (Python package installer)
* Git (for cloning the repository)

## Installation

To set up the Project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adarsh0427/CV_assignment_1.git
   cd CV_assignment_1
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
